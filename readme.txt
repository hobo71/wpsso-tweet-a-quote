== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-tweet-a-quote/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**Add Twitter-style quoted text to your content, with a convenient Tweet share link.**

Features an easy "Tweet a Quote" toolbar button in the Visual Editor (aka TinyMCE) &mdash; along with a simple shortcode for the Text Editor &mdash; to create Tweetable quotes quickly and easily.

Uses your existing WPSSO Core settings to shorten URLs, add a Twitter business @username, and recommend the author's @username after tweeting the quote.

Developers and advanced users will also appreciate the ability to easily re-style the default CSS that WPSSO Tweet a Quote uses. ;-)
