**WPSSO TAQ is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

WPSSO Core and its extensions make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light.

WPSSO Core and its extensions are fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.3 or better required).
